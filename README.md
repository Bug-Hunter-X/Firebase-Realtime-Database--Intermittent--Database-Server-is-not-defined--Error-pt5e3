# Firebase Realtime Database: Intermittent `Database.Server is not defined` Error

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase Realtime Database intermittently throws a `DatabaseError: Database.Server is not defined` error.  The error occurs despite correct database rules and app permissions.  The solution provided addresses potential causes and offers mitigation strategies.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to interact with the Firebase Realtime Database.  Under certain circumstances (often seemingly random), it throws the `DatabaseError: Database.Server is not defined` error. This is problematic because it's not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a revised version of the code that addresses potential causes of the error, including:

* **Network Connectivity Issues:** Improved error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented to deal with transient network problems.
* **Database Rule Conflicts:**  Double-checking of rules (although assumed correct in the original, this is confirmed).
* **Firebase Initialization:**  Ensuring correct and complete Firebase initialization before database interactions.

This solution incorporates best practices for robust Firebase interactions, increasing the reliability of your application.
